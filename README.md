## Introduction

Just a little [shareable configuration](https://commitlint.js.org/#/reference-configuration) for [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/) to be able to validate the addition of an issue number to the end of a commit message that follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

The commit message structure must be:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description> [<issue-number>]
```

Where:

- `<type>` is mandatory
- `<scope>` is optional
- `<description>` is mandatory
- `<issue-number>` is mandatory 

## Usage

Install [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/#/guides-local-setup) and this configuration:

```
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @d3p1/commitlint-config-conventional
```

Then, extend this configuration from your [`commitlint` configuration object](https://commitlint.js.org/#/reference-configuration?id=configuration-object-example) using the `extends` option. For example, create in the root of your project a `commitlint.config.js` file with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
    extends: ['@d3p1/commitlint-config-conventional']
};
```

Also, to be able to validate your commit messages in your environment, install and configure [`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/):

```
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit ${1}'
```

And you are ready to go! From now on, all messages from your commits will be validated to ensure they adhere to the format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description> [<issue-number>]
```
